# VersatileSegmentation

Official code for our CVPR 2024 paper [Versatile Medical Image Segmentation Learned from Multi-Source Datasets via Model Self-Disambiguation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10696).

The method was developed for segmenting abdominal organs. ![abdominal organs](https://github.com/MLDataAnalytics/OrganSegmentation/blob/main/Figures/visual_comparision_label.png)

Detailed instructions for using the code will come soon!
